- Good luck!

1. The sum of the squares of two numbers is 2019 and the product of the two numbers is 95 . What is the sum of the two numbers?
2. How many ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ exist such that $1 / a+1 / b=1 / 4$ ?
3. How many natural numbers less than 2019 are there such that its remainder when divided by 2 is 1 , when divided by 3 is 2 , when divided by 4 is 3 , and when divided by 5 is 4 ?
4. Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients where the sum of the coefficients is equal to 2019. Also, $P(x)$ satisfies

$$
P(-x)=-P(x)
$$

The remainder, $Q(x)$, obtained by dividing $P(x)$ by $x^{3}-x$ has the form $p x^{2}+q x+r$, where $p, q$, and $r$ are constants. Find $p+q+r$.

5. The given polynomial $P(X)$ has leading coefficient 1 and satisfies the functional equation below:

$$
(X+1) P(X)=(X-10) P(X+1)
$$

Compute P(5).
6. $\left(\begin{array}{c}1000 \\ 0\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c}1000 \\ 2\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}1000 \\ 4\end{array}\right)-\cdots+\left(\begin{array}{c}1000 \\ 1000\end{array}\right)=2^{A}$. Find $A$.

7. Given the quadratic equation $a x^{2}-b x+c=0$, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$, find the coefficients $a, b, c$ such that the equation has the roots $a, b$ and discriminant $c$. Compute $\frac{4 c}{a b}$.
8. The equation below has only one real solution of the form $a / b$ where $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Find $a+b$.

$$
x^{3}+(x+1)^{3}+(x+2)^{3}+(x+3)^{3}=0
$$

9. Given that the equation $\left(1+x+{ }^{2}+x^{3}+\ldots+x^{17}\right)^{2}-x^{17}=0$ has 34 complex roots of the form $z_{k}=r_{k}\left[\cos \left(2 \pi a_{k}\right)+i \sin \left(2 \pi a_{k}\right)\right], k=1,2,3, \ldots, 34$, with $0<a_{1} \leq a_{2} \leq a_{3} \leq \ldots \leq a_{34}<1$ and $r_{k}>0$. Find $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5}$. Given the answer is in the form $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$, compute $\alpha+\beta$.
10. The roots, $a, b, c$, of the equation $x^{3}-4 x^{2}+5 x-19 / 10=0$ are real and can form the sides of a triangle. Given the area of the triangle has form $\sqrt{q} / p$ where $p$ is an integer and $\sqrt{q}$ is in simplest radical form, find $p+q$.
